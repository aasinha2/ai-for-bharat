## 1. System Overview

SHRAM-AI is a cloud-native, serverless platform built on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It transforms informal work experience into verifiable digital credentials, provides wage transparency, and connects workers to employers — all through simple, accessible channels (voice, WhatsApp, missed calls).

The architecture follows event-driven microservices principles with a multi-agent AI orchestration layer. It is designed for high scalability, low cost per user, and rapid deployment across India's diverse rural landscape.

### 1.1 Problem We Solve

India has 49 crore informal workers — carpenters, masons, electricians, ASHA workers, and more. They possess decades of skill but zero formal proof. A master with 12 years experience earns ₹450/day while a fresh certificate holder earns ₹700/day. Same work. Double the paper. Double the pay.

This isn't a skill gap. It's a proof gap — and a ₹20 lakh crore annual economic inefficiency. 31 crore workers are already registered on e-Shram, waiting for validation.

### 1.2 Our Solution

SHRAM-AI gives every worker an AI advocate that:
- Validates their skill through a voice conversation in their mother tongue
- Issues a blockchain-backed, tamper-proof credential in DigiLocker
- Shows them their true market value and exactly how much they're losing
- Finds and applies for jobs while they sleep
- Recommends the one skill upgrade that adds most to their daily wage
- Protects them from exploitation through contracts and blacklists

All on WhatsApp. No app. No literacy barrier. Built for Bharat.

## 2. Design Philosophy

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Serverless First** | Minimize operational overhead, auto-scale to zero |
| **Agentic AI** | Proactive agents that act on behalf of workers |
| **Privacy by Design** | Worker controls data; blockchain stores only hashes |
| **Rural-First** | Works on 2G, feature phones, low literacy |
| **API-Led Connectivity** | All functionality exposed via APIs |
| **Government Ready** | Built on India's DPI from day one |
| **Offline Capable** | Workers can interact without real-time connectivity |
| **Cost Optimized** | < ₹20 per worker per year at scale |
